		    			</div>
		    			<p>Sir Adiba Krishna Sinai Kenkre has been actively involved in youth development and also associated with professional soccer in India, he always felt that we needed to develop the overall standard of soccer at the grassroot level so that India can continually generate quality soccer players who can compete and win at the international level. To cater to this need, Kenkre Football Club was born in 2000. </p>
		    			<br><br>
		    			
		    			<p>His goal is to inspire as many youngsters as possible to play the beautiful game by imparting his love and passion for the game. Since his earlier coaching days at Don Bosco, Matunga, he realised the need to tap and nurture talented youngsters, while at the same time keeping them focused on a soccer career. The Club was formed with the intention of showcasing those talents, produced through an Academy structure, that are believed to be the new crop of Indian soccer players. Thus, the Club is the fruition of all the hard work and dedication put into the Academy. In a short duration, the Club has managed to achieve outstanding results and gain consecutive promotions to compete in the Elite league in Mumbai.</p>
